# BondX Liquidity Pulse System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The BondX Liquidity Pulse system has been successfully implemented as a comprehensive real-time liquidity monitoring and forecasting platform. This system fuses repayment support (alternative data fundamentals) with immediate demand/supply (market microstructure, auction/MM telemetry, sentiment) to provide a 0-100 liquidity index, repayment support index, combined BondX Score, and short-horizon forecasts.

### Algorithm Implementation

#### Liquidity Index Calculation
```python
# Feature weights for liquidity index
feature_weights = {
    "spread_bps": -0.3,           # Higher spread = lower liquidity
    "depth_density": 0.2,         # Higher depth = higher liquidity
    "turnover_velocity": 0.15,    # Higher turnover = higher liquidity
    "mm_online_ratio": 0.15,      # MM online = higher liquidity
    "auction_demand": 0.1,        # Higher demand = higher liquidity
    "time_since_last_trade": -0.1 # Longer time = lower liquidity
}
```

#### Repayment Support Calculation
```python
# Feature weights for repayment support
feature_weights = {
    "traffic_index": 0.25,           # Traffic as proxy for economic activity
    "utilities_index": 0.2,          # Utilities as proxy for stability
    "sentiment_intensity": 0.15,     # Sentiment as proxy for market perception
    "buzz_volume": 0.1,              # Buzz as proxy for attention
    "spread_stability": 0.2,         # Spread stability as proxy for market confidence
    "depth_stability": 0.1           # Depth stability as proxy for investor confidence
}
```

#### BondX Score Calculation
```python
# Sector-specific weight adjustments
sector_weights = {
    "FINANCIAL": {"liquidity": 0.7, "repayment": 0.3},
    "UTILITIES": {"liquidity": 0.4, "repayment": 0.6},
    "INDUSTRIAL": {"liquidity": 0.5, "repayment": 0.5},
    "GOVERNMENT": {"liquidity": 0.3, "repayment": 0.7}
}
```
