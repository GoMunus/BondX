## 📊 Reconciliation Procedures

### Procedure 1: Trade vs Position vs Cash Reconciliation

#### T+0 Real-Time Reconciliation
**Trigger:** Every trade execution  
**Scope:** Individual trade impact on positions and cash  

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Trade Execution Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Verify trade execution
   SELECT trade_id, instrument_id, quantity, price, trade_time
   FROM trades 
   WHERE trade_time >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 minute'
   ORDER BY trade_time DESC;
   ```

2. **Position Update Verification**
   ```sql
   -- Check position changes
   SELECT p.instrument_id, p.quantity, p.last_update_time,
          t.trade_id, t.quantity as trade_qty, t.side
   FROM positions p
   JOIN trades t ON p.instrument_id = t.instrument_id
   WHERE t.trade_time >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 minute'
   AND p.last_update_time >= t.trade_time;
   ```

3. **Cash Balance Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Verify cash impact
   SELECT account_id, cash_balance, last_update_time,
          SUM(CASE WHEN side = 'BUY' THEN -quantity * price 
                   WHEN side = 'SELL' THEN quantity * price END) as trade_impact
   FROM trades t
   JOIN accounts a ON t.account_id = a.account_id
   WHERE t.trade_time >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 minute'
   GROUP BY account_id, cash_balance, last_update_time;
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- Position changes match trade quantities and sides
- Cash balance changes equal trade value impact
- All updates completed within 100ms of trade execution
- Zero orphaned trades or position updates

#### T+1 End-of-Day Reconciliation
**Trigger:** Daily after market close  
**Scope:** Complete daily activity reconciliation  

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Opening vs Closing Positions**
   ```sql
   -- Compare opening and closing positions
   SELECT 
       instrument_id,
       opening_quantity,
       closing_quantity,
       net_change,
       SUM(CASE WHEN side = 'BUY' THEN quantity ELSE -quantity END) as calculated_change
   FROM positions p
   JOIN daily_position_snapshots d ON p.instrument_id = d.instrument_id
   JOIN trades t ON p.instrument_id = t.instrument_id
   WHERE DATE(t.trade_time) = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
   GROUP BY instrument_id, opening_quantity, closing_quantity, net_change;
   ```

2. **Cash Flow Reconciliation**
   ```sql
   -- Reconcile cash flows
   SELECT 
       account_id,
       opening_balance,
       closing_balance,
       net_cash_flow,
       SUM(CASE WHEN side = 'BUY' THEN -quantity * price 
                WHEN side = 'SELL' THEN quantity * price END) as trade_cash_flow,
       SUM(fees) as total_fees
   FROM accounts a
   JOIN trades t ON a.account_id = t.account_id
   JOIN daily_cash_snapshots d ON a.account_id = d.account_id
   WHERE DATE(t.trade_time) = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
   GROUP BY account_id, opening_balance, closing_balance, net_cash_flow;
   ```

3. **Trade Summary Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Validate trade summary
   SELECT 
       COUNT(*) as total_trades,
       SUM(quantity * price) as total_volume,
       COUNT(DISTINCT account_id) as active_accounts,
       COUNT(DISTINCT instrument_id) as active_instruments
   FROM trades 
   WHERE DATE(trade_time) = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day';
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- Position changes match trade activity exactly
- Cash flows reconcile with trade values and fees
- Opening + changes = closing balances
- Zero unexplained discrepancies

### Procedure 2: Auction Allocations vs Fills vs Settlement Ledger

   FROM auctions a
   JOIN auction_allocations aa ON a.auction_id = aa.auction_id
   LEFT JOIN trades t ON a.auction_id = t.auction_id
   WHERE a.status = 'COMPLETED'
   AND a.completion_time >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
   GROUP BY a.auction_id, a.instrument_id, aa.allocated_quantity;
   ```

3. **Settlement Instruction Generation**
   ```sql
   -- Generate settlement instructions
   SELECT 
       account_id,
       instrument_id,
       quantity,
       settlement_amount,
       settlement_date,
       'AUCTION_' || auction_id as reference
   FROM auction_allocations aa
   JOIN auctions a ON aa.auction_id = a.auction_id
