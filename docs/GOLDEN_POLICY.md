# Golden Dataset Vault Policy

This document defines the policy for managing the Golden Dataset Vault, including who can approve baseline changes, how to review diffs, and the approval process.

## Purpose

The Golden Dataset Vault serves as a "source of truth" for quality validation outcomes. It prevents silent drift in quality behavior and ensures that intentional changes are properly reviewed and documented.

## Policy Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Immutability**: Baselines are immutable without explicit approval
2. **Transparency**: All changes are logged and tracked
3. **Accountability**: Changes require named reviewer approval
4. **Documentation**: Rationale and impact must be documented
5. **Testing**: Changes must pass validation against other datasets

### Baseline Update Policy

#### Who Can Approve

- **Quality Team Lead**: Can approve all baseline updates
- **Senior Data Engineer**: Can approve updates for datasets they own
- **DevOps Lead**: Can approve updates related to infrastructure changes
- **Regulatory Compliance Officer**: Must approve any changes affecting compliance

#### Approval Requirements

1. **Named Reviewer**: All changes require a named, authorized reviewer
2. **Reason Documentation**: Clear rationale for the change must be provided
3. **Impact Assessment**: Expected impact on quality outcomes must be documented
4. **Policy Version**: Policy version must be updated if applicable
5. **Testing**: Changes must pass validation against other golden datasets

#### Change Types

##### Automatic Updates (No Approval Required)

- **Timestamp Updates**: Changes to non-deterministic timestamps
- **Minor Formatting**: Changes to whitespace or formatting that don't affect validation
- **Metadata Updates**: Changes to generation metadata or file paths

##### Approval Required

- **Validation Logic Changes**: Changes to validation rules or thresholds
- **Quality Gate Changes**: Changes to quality gate behavior
- **Policy Updates**: Changes to quality policy configuration
- **Data Schema Changes**: Changes to expected data structure
- **Threshold Adjustments**: Changes to validation thresholds

## Review Process

### 1. Change Request

The requester must submit a change request with:

- **Dataset Name**: Which golden dataset is affected
- **Change Description**: What is being changed and why
- **Impact Analysis**: Expected impact on quality outcomes
- **Testing Plan**: How the change will be validated
- **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if issues arise

### 2. Technical Review

A technical reviewer must:

- **Code Review**: Review the code changes that affect quality behavior
- **Impact Assessment**: Verify the claimed impact is accurate
- **Testing Validation**: Ensure the change passes all tests
- **Documentation Review**: Verify documentation is updated

### 3. Policy Review

A policy reviewer must:

- **Policy Compliance**: Ensure changes comply with quality policies
- **Regulatory Impact**: Assess impact on regulatory compliance
- **Business Impact**: Evaluate impact on business operations
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and mitigate risks

### 4. Final Approval

The authorized approver must:

- **Verify Requirements**: Ensure all requirements are met
- **Approve Change**: Provide final approval with signature
- **Update Changelog**: Document the approval in the changelog
- **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform relevant teams of the change

## Diff Review Process

### What to Look For

#### Critical Changes

1. **Validation Logic**: Changes to validation rules or algorithms
2. **Threshold Values**: Changes to pass/fail thresholds
3. **Data Requirements**: Changes to required fields or data types
4. **Error Handling**: Changes to error messages or severity levels

#### Expected Changes

1. **Timestamps**: Changes to generation or validation timestamps
2. **File Paths**: Changes to file locations or names
3. **Metadata**: Changes to generation metadata or version info
4. **Formatting**: Changes to output formatting or structure

### Review Checklist

- [ ] **Functional Impact**: Does the change affect validation outcomes?
- [ ] **Policy Compliance**: Does the change comply with quality policies?
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: Are there tests for the changed behavior?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is the change documented and explained?
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Is there a plan to revert if needed?
- [ ] **Stakeholder Notification**: Are relevant teams notified?

### Diff Analysis Tools

#### Command Line Tools

```bash
# Compare baseline files
diff -u baseline/old_file.json baseline/new_file.json

# Compare with context
diff -u -C 5 baseline/old_file.json baseline/new_file.json

# Ignore whitespace changes
diff -u -w baseline/old_file.json baseline/new_file.json
```

#### Visualization Tools

- **VS Code**: Built-in diff viewer
- **Git**: `git diff` and `git difftool`
- **Online Tools**: Diffchecker, Diffnow
- **IDE Tools**: PyCharm, IntelliJ diff viewers

## Approval Workflow

### Step 1: Change Identification

1. **Detect Change**: Automated system detects baseline drift
2. **Analyze Impact**: Determine scope and impact of change
3. **Classify Change**: Categorize as automatic or approval-required

### Step 2: Change Request

1. **Submit Request**: Requester submits change request
2. **Initial Review**: Technical reviewer performs initial assessment
3. **Impact Analysis**: Detailed impact analysis performed
4. **Testing**: Changes tested against other datasets

### Step 3: Review Process

1. **Technical Review**: Code and logic review
2. **Policy Review**: Policy and compliance review
3. **Business Review**: Business impact assessment
4. **Risk Assessment**: Risk identification and mitigation

### Step 4: Approval

1. **Final Review**: Authorized approver reviews all materials
2. **Approval Decision**: Approve, reject, or request changes
3. **Documentation**: Update changelog and documentation
4. **Implementation**: Apply approved changes

### Step 5: Post-Change

1. **Verification**: Verify changes are applied correctly
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unexpected side effects
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Training**: Train team members on new behavior

## Emergency Changes

### When Emergency Changes Are Allowed

- **Critical Security Issues**: Security vulnerabilities in quality logic
- **Production Failures**: Quality system failures affecting production
- **Regulatory Deadlines**: Compliance requirements with immediate deadlines
- **Data Corruption**: Data integrity issues requiring immediate fixes

### Emergency Change Process
